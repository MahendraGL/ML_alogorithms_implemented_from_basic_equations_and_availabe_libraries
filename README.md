# ML_alogorithms_implemented_from_basic_equations_following_AndrewNG_MLnotes

I gald to share this repository where I have complied many ML algoirthms implemented using python. And I have tried to comapare most of them with the python libraries such as Sk-learn. 
This reposity follows Andrew NG's ML notes available freely on the internet. 
- I will keep updating the page as soon as I learn new algorithm.
